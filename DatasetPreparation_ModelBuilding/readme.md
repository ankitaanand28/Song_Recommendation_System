# Explanation on Modeling:
<p>
The code starts by applying TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse
Document Frequency) vectorization on the 'Artist_genres'
column, which represents the genres associated with artists. It
then processes audio features and other information related to
tracks and artists from the Spotify API.
  
### Cosine Similarity

<b> Cosine similarity </b>  is calculated between the entire dataset and
a user's playlist , which is used to measure the similarity
between the user's playlist and other tracks.The DataFrame is
sorted by cosine similarity in descending
order.Recommendations are generated by selecting tracks
that are most similar to the user's playlist, and the top 50 tracks
are chosen.
</p>

# Model Deployment
<ul>
<li>Users will input their playlist, which should be a list of tracks
or songs. </li>
<li>Data Integration:
Check if each track from the user's playlist exists in your
dataset. If any are missing, add them automatically. This
ensures that you have vectors for all songs in the playlist. </li>
<li> Playlist Vectorization:
Convert the user's playlist into a single vector using the
same feature extraction methods and preprocessing used
for the rest of the dataset. </li>
<li> Cosine Similarity:
Calculate the cosine similarity between the user's playlist
vector and the vectors of all songs in your dataset. This will
help identify songs that are most similar to the user's
taste. </li>
<li> Recommendation: Rank the songs based on their cosine
similarity scores, and recommend the top N songs to the user </li>
</ul>
